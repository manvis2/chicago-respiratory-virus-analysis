# ðŸ¦  Respiratory Virus Trends in Chicago (2017â€“2024)
This project analyzes respiratory virus activity in Chicago using publicly available surveillance data from the City of Chicago Data Portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Influenza-COVID-19-RSV-and-Other-Respiratory-Virus/qgdz-d5m4/about_data. 

The dataset includes weekly lab-confirmed counts and positivity rates for multiple respiratory pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19, RSV, and other viruses, updated regularly by the Chicago Department of Public Health.

Understanding seasonal and year-over-year patterns in viral transmission can help inform local public health planning, early warning systems, and vaccination efforts. This project leverages descriptive statistics and exploratory visualizations to examine how virus trends have evolved in recent years.
### Project Goal
To apply core data science tools to analyze infectious disease surveillance trends in an urban setting and extract insights that support epidemiological understanding and decision-making.
The analysis includes:

1. Summary statistics and trends in total testing and positivity rates

2. Visualization of multi-pathogen trends over time

3. Boxplots and bar graphs to compare seasonal variation and spread

4. A correlation matrix to examine associations between testing volume and positivity

This work was completed as part of my coursework in the Computer Programming for Public Health class at the University of Chicago. As a Master of Public Health (MPH) student specializing in Data Science, I used this opportunity to explore how programming tools can be applied to real-world epidemiological data.
The project was built using Python, with Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, producing line plots, boxplots, and bar charts to summarize key insights across years and virus types.

This project reflects my broader interest in infectious disease tracking and public health analytics, and demonstrates my ability to apply data science tools to real-world health data. I designed the project to be readable, reproducible, and extendable for future analysis, such as by incorporating geographic data to explore spatial patterns in virus spread across the city by neighborhoods.
